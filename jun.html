        <p>My name is Tony Chen. I am a transfer 
            student from a community college in Salisbury, Maryland. 
            Today, I'm currently a sophomore at Drexel University. 
            My family is originally from China and moved to America in 
            2006. My father works presently at East Moon, a Japanese 
            restaurant. When I was young, my parents separated, and 
            my mother chose to stay in China. I spend most of my life 
            with my father</p>
