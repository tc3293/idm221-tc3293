        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jun Chen. I am currently at Drexel University to study
            User Experience and Interaction Design. My family is originally from
            China and moved to American in 2006. When I was young, my parents 
            separated and my mother chose to stay in China. I live with my 
            father. I have worked to support my family since I was 12 years old.
            We have moved around a lot ever since we arrived in American to give
            us better opportunities. I will be the first in our family to attend
            University.
