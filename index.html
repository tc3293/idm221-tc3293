    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Jun Chen, a full-time Drexel University student. At Drexel University's
        Westphal College, I am pursuing a degree in User Experience and Interaction Design. 
        Learning new things is something I'm quite enthusiastic about. I was born in China 
        and moved to the United States with my father when I was six years old. My parents 
        separated when I was young, and my mother preferred to remain in China. Since I was 
        7 years old, I've taught myself computer knowledge, cooking skills, and household chores. 
        I've developed an interest in computer skills; I enjoy video editing and creating unique 
        designs to improve technology. It depends on what I can accomplish in my spare time, 
        but I primarily enjoy cooking and editing or watching videos on YouTube. In addition, 
        I'd like to read manga and watch anime.
