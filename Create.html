  My name is Tony Chen. I am a transfer student from a community college in Salisbury, Maryland. Today, I'm currently a sophomore at Drexel University. My family is originally from China and moved to America in 2006. My father works presently at East Moon, a Japanese restaurant. When I was young, my parents separated, and my mother chose to stay in China. I spend most of my life with my father.<p>

  I have worked to support my family since I was 14 years old. I work on weekends as a packer at my father's workplace. We moved around a lot ever since we arrived in America to give us better opportunities. As the oldest child, I will be the first in our family to attend university.<p>

  I was born with severe damage to my hearing. At age two, I got a high fever that caused this severe damage to my hearing. I wear hearing aids all the time. Sometimes I cannot hear clearly at distances, even if people shout at me. My hearing loss negatively impacted my life because asking people to repeat what they say can be irritating.<p>

  It is hard to communicate or have conversations with people when I do not hear clearly and miss several words. It isn't easy to hear clear when people speak fast. It is slightly more complex and confusing when a person is whispering to me in a crowded place. I also misunderstand conversations when words have similar pronunciations, like "Prey and pray."<p>
